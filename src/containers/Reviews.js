<p>A friend recommended that I try their fish cocktails ! He claimed they were the best he had ever had . Said they were clean, fresh and fluffy and that I was missing out . He was absolutly right . They were amazing and the service was friendly. I try to stop in every time i drive to Heathcote. I recommend parkink behind the IGA and walking to the shop as it can be hard to pull up on the main highway but i would recommend these to anyway passing through.
